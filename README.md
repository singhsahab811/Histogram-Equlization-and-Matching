# Histograms
A histogram is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. Histograms are made up of bins, each bin representing a certain intensity value range. The histogram is computed by examining all pixels in the image and assigning each to a bin depending on the pixel intensity. The final value of a bin is the number of pixels assigned to it. The number of bins in which the whole intensity range is divided is usually in the order of the square root of the number of pixels.![Satellite_Matching](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63724473/131136489-12a483b4-bead-49dd-a74c-b7b6979b399c.PNG)
